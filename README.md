# Pavement-RCNN
Detection of pavement damages using deep learning technologies. The object detection algorithms based on RCNN are the most popular methods, such as rcnn, fast rcnn, faster rcnn, ssd, yolo etc. Besides the detection, pixel-wise instance  segmentation is also necessary for the pavement damages evaluation. This project plan to use the stat-of-art Mask RCNN algorithms to detect and segment the road surface damages, like cracks and potholes.
